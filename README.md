# HungerGames
=============

BIG NOTE
---------
COMPILING IT WITH pmt.mcpe.me WILL MAKE THE PLUGIN CORRUPTED. DOWNLOAD FROM _RELEASES_ [HERE](https://github.com/InfinityGamers/HungerGames-UPDATED/releases/latest)

A HungerGames plugin for PocketMine-MP developed by xBeastMode continued by xXSirGamesXx
--------------------------------------------------------------

#New Features? 
Yes, of course. You can choose between SkyWars or HungerGames!
How? You can make a game with the following command: /hg add <game name>
Then, run the command "/reload", and check the config inside the folder "arenas", inside the plugin folder. Configure it to your needs, there you will find the "is_sky_wars" option, set it to true to make it skywars ;)

<h3> 
When you join a game the plugin will automatically backup the map.
</h3>

- Other features: Scripts have been added. I did not make any scripts for it yet, maybe in the future.

#How to setup a join sign?

on the first line set the line to "hg" and on the second line set the line to the name of your game.
Next, reload your server with the "/hg reload" command.
The sign should now refresh automatically and you'll be able to join.

#Future updates? 
I am planning to adding many more features to this plugin, if you wish me to add one, please say it in issues, thank you.

- For Devs:

This plugin comes with a script loader api. You can use this to access game functions, like when player joins, quits, wins, etc. You do not need to enable it, as it loads itself.
